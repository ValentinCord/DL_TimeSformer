# **ADL-3 Project**


Apply a deep neural network to detect movements or actions in a video sequence using the TimeSformer architecture. You can carry out the experiments using the mmaction2 framework and a database illustrating dangerous situations in railway yards (to be provided). Analyse, interpret and visualise the results.
   
Optional: Analyse the database by viewing its characteristics such as class distribution, video duration distribution, number of frames per video, etc. .
